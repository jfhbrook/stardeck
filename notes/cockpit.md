# Cockpit

I have cockpit installed and running:

<https://stardeck.local:9090>

But it's not configured in any way.

If I want to go full headless, I'd want Cockpit to be capable of doing *most* things.

Some Cockpit related projects that could be valuable to set up at some point:

* <https://github.com/45Drives/cockpit-file-sharing>
* Old but promising: <https://github.com/cyberorg/apsetup-cockpit>
