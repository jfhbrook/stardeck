# mixer?

Using PulseAudio for mixing seems to have performance issues. I have to confirm that's the issue I'm hearing, but assuming so...

...the alternative is an external audio mixer. My choices there are either an active or a passive mixer, the difference being that the former has an amplifier.

A strong motivation for a passive mixer is that there won't be an amp in between the raw audio and the receiver. However, they necessarily lower the volume of the output. If the tape deck and PC both output significantly higher volume than the CD player, then that's not a problem. If I also mix the CD player in then it's even less of a problem. But it's a bit of an unknown.

Here's one that's apparently American made and of decent quality:

The other options are oddball Chinese shit or super expensive recording grade Yamaha mixers, so...
