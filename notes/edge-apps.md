# edge apps

On a normal machine, I'd set up MS Edge and Edge Apps. However, I'm not doing it in this case:

1. Setting up Edge is annoying on Linux. It's slightly more effort than I want to do.
2. Performance on the machine is not very good, to the point that having browser windows open affects playback. Therefore, I *don't* want to invest in graphical stuff - I want to instead focus on getting Mopidy to play YT music headlessly.
