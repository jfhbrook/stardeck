# Bluetooth Shenanigans

Bluetooth pairing is a MESS.

First, a lot of the scripts/tools say to use `sbc`, which has more or less been sunset. Some documentation on that lives here:

But also, Fedora uses PipeWire by default. It _appears_ that PipeWire handles this differently - but perhaps better?

I suspect that this stuff is configurable with... whatever UI-driven tools pipewire has.
