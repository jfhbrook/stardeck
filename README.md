# Stardeck

The Stardeck 1A Media Appliance is a PC I built, with the following specs:

- 2008 era media center PC case
- KDE flavor of Fedora Linux
- [Plus Deck 2C PC Cassette Deck](https://github.com/jfhbrook/plusdeck)
- [Crystalfontz LCD display](https://github.com/jfhbrook/crystalfontz)

This repository contains custom software I wrote for the device, in order to make it behave *somewhat* like a consumer media appliance.

For more information on the individual components, check the READMEs for individual components.
